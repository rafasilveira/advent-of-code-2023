# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is a challenge taking place in December 2023. Each day until Christmas a new puzzle will be released, consisting of two parts. Once part one is completed, second part will be available. Goal is to get 50 stars (aka solve 2 puzzles a day).

I'm going with Python just for fun. I like Python.
